ImageSelector is a Xamarin Crossplatform app that allows you pick image from your gallery. With the code you could more than that, 
you may take real time pics and vids, you may also upload multiple pics and vids. 
The app then lets you upload the selected images in real time to the cloud where you get a return url for it. 
This allows you to save images (no matter how big) into stream of letters with just bytes of size.
